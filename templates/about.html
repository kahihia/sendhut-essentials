Sendhut is reimagining the delivery experience, and we are working towards that by first enabling lunch deliveries. Every menu is sourced from local chefs and restaurants offering a unique take on a cuisine.  Your lunch is neatly packed and fresh, with dietary restrictions noted; ready to eat when you are.
