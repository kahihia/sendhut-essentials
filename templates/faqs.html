    <h5>About Sendhut</h5>

    <p> At Sendhut, we want to make delivering anything easy, for everyday use or business. We are working towards that by first enabling lunch deliveries. Every menu is sourced from local chefs and restaurants offering a unique take on a cuisine.  Your lunch is neatly packed and fresh, with dietary restrictions noted; ready to eat when you are.
    </p>
    <h6>How does SendHut work. </h6>
    <p> You can order on the website from all the great restaurants we have partnered with.
       Once you've placed your order before 10am for same day delivery. we work with the restaurant to prepare and package it. Once it's all ready, a rider will pick it up and bring it to your delivery address. While there are a lot of moving pieces to any order, we strive to bring your meal to your door on time.
